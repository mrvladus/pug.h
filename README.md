# PUG.H

PUG.H is a stupidly simple build system designed for small C/C++ projects.
It consists of a single header file that you can easily copy into your project.
PUG.H requires only a C compiler to build itself, making it lightweight and straightforward to use.

## Features

- **Single Header File**: Just copy `pug.h` to your project.
- **Super Small**: Less than 300 lines of code.
- **No Dependencies**: Requires only a C compiler.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple syntax to create your builds.
- **Incremental Builds**: PUG rebuilds only changed source files for fast incremental compilation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)

### Usage

1. Copy `pug.h` to your project directory.
2. Create a build file named `pug.c`:

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use PUG.H in your project:

```c
#define CC "clang" // You can change the C compiler using this. "gcc" is the default.
#include "pug.h"

int main(int argc, const char **argv) {
    // Auto-rebuild PUG if this file is changed
    pug_self_rebuild();
    // Create new executable target
    Executable exe = {
        .name = "example",                     // Required field
        .sources = SOURCES("main.c", "lib.c"), // Required field
        .cflags = "-Wall -Wextra",             // Optional field
        .ldflags = "-lm",                      // Optional field
    };

    // Clean build files if run with "./pug clean"
    if (argc == 2 && !strcmp(argv[1], "clean")) {
        executable_clean(&exe);
        return 0;
    }

    // Build it
    executable_build(&exe);
}
```

3. Build `pug` with `gcc -o pug pug.c`
4. Run `./pug` to build your project
5. Run `./pug clean` to clean up the build files
