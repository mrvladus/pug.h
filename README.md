# pug.h

</div>

**pug.h** is a stupidly simple build system designed for C/C++ projects.
It consists of a single header file that you can easily copy into your project.
**pug.h** requires only a C compiler to build itself, making it lightweight and straightforward to use.

## Features

- **Single Header File**: Just copy `pug.h` to your project.
- **Tiny**: Less than 500 lines of code.
- **No Dependencies**: Requires only a C compiler.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple syntax to create your builds.
- **Incremental Builds**: PUG rebuilds only changed source files for fast incremental compilation.
- **Self-rebuild**: If build file `pug.c` changes - it will rebuild itself.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)

### Usage

1. Copy `pug.h` to your project directory.
2. Create a build file named `pug.c`:

Hereâ€™s a simplest example of how to use **pug.h** in your project:

```c
#include "pug.h"

static bool build_hello() {
    PugTarget hello_bin = pug_target_new("hello", PUG_TARGET_TYPE_EXECUTABLE, "build");
    pug_target_add_sources(&hello_bin, "src/main.c", NULL);
    pug_target_add_cflags(&hello_bin, "-Wall", "-Wextra", NULL);
    return pug_target_build(&hello_bin);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  pug_init(argc, argv);
  if(!build_hello()) return 1;
  return 0;
}
```

3. Build `pug` with `gcc -o pug pug.c`
4. Run `./pug` to build your project
